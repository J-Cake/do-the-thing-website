# What is a chatbot?

A chatbot is a computer program created to simulate human conversation via text or voice. Through the implementation of various branch technologies of Artificial Intelligence such as Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, chatbots can ‘understand’ and converse with human users to collect and deliver information in a human like manner.
Ranging from the most basic FAQ answering programs, to intuitive ‘virtual assistants’ able to ‘learn’ and remember a user’s preferences, chatbots range in complexity to cater to client demands.

In today’s market, chatbots can be split into 3 main categories.

## Menu/Button chatbot.
The most common and basic type that is employed by industries to deal with FAQS and general user queries. Using a combination of creator set rules, Natural Language Processing, and minor Machine Learning principals, they generate conversation-like responses to user queries based on their selection.
Pros:
* Ease of creation and deployment. 
* Minimal human supervision required as the chatbot isn’t exposed to a situation that it can’t handle.
Cons:
* Limited flexibility for users. If a user has a query that falls out of the scope of the supplied options, then they must look elsewhere for answers.
* Lack of personalization as the chatbot is unable to ‘remember’ conversations 

An example of a menu/button chatbot is Menumonkey.
This software uses a menu chatbot to allow users to create menu chatbots.

As seen in the example, the chatbot gives specific ‘topics’ for users to select.

Upon selection, in this case Facebook, the user is given some information relating to their selection and further button choices for more in-depth information.

## Key-word recognition chatbots.
This chatbot is an extension of the menu variant. It takes data input from a user and identifies keywords that it uses to compile and generate possible results. Technologically, these chatbots are just advanced menu chatbots with an increased database and the ability to search and match possible user inputs to recommended results. Many key-word recognition chatbots still output menu like results.
Pros:
* Better conversation flow as users can be more specific with queries
* More realistic conversations which increases user engagement.
* Greater scope of questions and answers
Cons:
* Higher risk of the chatbot running into a situation outside of its scope. As seen in the example below.

As seen in the example, Optus Chatbot asks for user input, which it breaks down into key words and presents a list of possible search results that the user may be interested in.

## Contextual chatbot.
The most advanced version is the contextual chatbot which uses varying degrees of Artificial Intelligence and its subfields machine learning and NLP to provide the highest degree of human like conversation. Contextual chatbots are programmed to store data from previous conversations with a user and draw upon this data, or ‘memory’ to produce a more catered experience.
Pros:
* Highest degree of human like conversation and personalization through application of predictive intelligence from previous interactions
Cons
* High cost to develop and deploy.
Alexa, Google Assistant and siri are examples of contextual chatbots. 

# Technologies used in chatbots:

1. ### NLP (Natural Language Processing)
    The most important technology involved in chatbots development is Natural Language Processing. 
    According to Wikipedia, NLP is the subfield of linguistics, computer science and AI concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.
    The purpose is to create programs which allow computers to ‘understand’ the human language and generate human-like responses. 
    NLP is a necessity in all chatbots.

2. ### Machine Learning
    Machine learning is a specific subset of AI that trains a machine how to learn without the need of human input(1). Using algorithms, machine learning tries to replicate human learning through trial and error to gradually increase accuracy.
    Through machine learning implementations, chatbots are able to understand and predict what customers are asking for.

3. ### Artificial Intelligence
    Artificial intelligence is the science of training machines to perform human tasks (1). Though this isn’t obvious in basic implementations of chatbots, AI will play a huge role in the future as chatbots go beyond just an onscreen presence.

# The impact of chatbots
Many industries today have adapted a self-service model to increase productivity and lower expenditure. One of the key components for this model is the deployment of chatbots to support online customer sales and service.
Some of the most compelling reasons for industries to implement chatbots are:
* 24/7 availability. So long as the hardware is running, the chatbot will be active for customers to self-serve at any time of the day or night.
* Faster response times and reduction of customer wait time. Unlike humans who can only handle a single query at a time, chatbots can process and respond to a multitude of customer queries at once. 
* Increased efficiency in detailed responses. Chatbots can process and return data within milliseconds from the time of request unlike humans who may need to think and search through troubleshoot guides. This can also result in company saving expenditure by reducing their human counterparts.
* Higher volume of customer sales and support turnover. With chatbots being capable of answering 80% of standard questions, this allows for human staff to focus their attention on more complex questions.
* Valuable data from conversation history. Companies can employ analytical tools to gain insights from customer behavior, product preferences, feedback and complaints from customer’s conversation history with the employed chatbot. 

As more industries employ chatbots to cater to the self-service model, we may see a decline, but not a complete replacement, of call center staff. The biggest reason is because the technology behind Chatbot, NLP and AI are simply not advanced enough to completely replace humans.

But, with the lessening of staff to deal with the mundane frequently asked questions, an increase in specialist staff will be required such as:
* Better trained ‘specialist’ customer relations staff to deal with situations that the chatbots can’t resolve. 
* IT technicians to service, manage and maintain the chatbots, ensuring they are up to date on company requirements. 

# Chatbots in the home.
With the addition of advanced chatbots packaged as ‘smart assistants’ like Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant, readily available in smart devices or kitchen top consoles, life is made that little bit easier at the touch of a finger, or in this case a few words like “Hey Google…”. 
For myself, this world is new and somewhat exciting. The addition of a ‘smart’ device that can converse with me and answer my questions had me intrigued. My family and I have taken on this new member and integrated her into our daily life.

From the kid’s morning weather queries, my wife’s favourite Spotify playlist requests, to my random cocktail recipe queries, Google Assistant is the go-to device that’s replaced the conventional ‘googling’ on the phone or computer. 
But its uses don’t stop there. Beyond the basics, there are various additional ‘quality of life’ addons that can be linked to the ‘smart assistant’. Some of them are:
* Adapter addons to enable control of power point outlets or even the home lights.
* Compatible smart devices like televisions, computers, phones, tablet, network hubs, printer.
* Door and window locks 
* Surveillance camera systems 
    The only reason I haven’t linked all the devices in the home is due to the concerns around possible security breaches and cost of upgrading all the hardware. As this technology is quite new, there may still be vulnerabilities that can easily be exploited to gain any data I entrust to the ‘smart assistant’. Even worse if my home doors can be bypassed and unlocked. But given time, I’m sure these concerns will lessen, once the technology has aged, like keyless entry cars.
    Though currently, not all technologies in a home can be accessed and controlled by these smart assistants it’s not a matter of if, but when they will be. I’m both excited and daunted to think that soon, we will see homes that are fully automated and controlled by these chatbots. 

# The future of chatbots

The growth of chatbot usage in recent decades is mainly due to the need for industries to have an online presence and accessibility 24/7. With this exposure, they must cater to the increased volume of queries from consumers, while maintaining a high level of personalized service. Though many consumers are content to self-service via computer chatbots, there will always be some who aren’t comfortable with the idea of talking to a machine. But a day will come when it’ll be near impossible for us to distinguish the difference between a chatbot and human support staff.
As AI technology advances, we see chatbots become more lifelike to the point where they can replicate such emotions as joy and sadness. Paired with the progress that the robotics field has made in recent years, it’s just a matter of time until we see actual robot butlers to do menial jobs around the office and home.

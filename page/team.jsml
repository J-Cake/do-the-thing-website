* Turbulent adventurers (ISFP-T) are known to possess the team oriented trait of sensitivity to others; relate to them, establish harmony and minimise conflict. Other traits include artistic, curious and imaginative. ISFP-Ts can show their creativity through tangible means, when interested in a topic they'll explore thoroughly on their own, and like to come up with bold ideas that appeal to others. 
* Visual learners are best able to learn through words, illustrations, diagrams, videos and the like. In a team setting, it's useful to have someone that easily comprehends charts, graphs, diagrams, etc, and can pick up on small visual details the others might have missed. 
* Kinaesthetic learners best engage with information hands on. In a team environment, this may be recognised due to a need for rigorous experimentation on some code, for example.]

* As a protagonist (ENFJ-T) helping others where help within reasonable capability can be provided is without a thought, this could be contributing a little on the website, doing some extra research, or even providing some ideas.  
* This also ties in with creativity. This aspect allows the group to filter and solve problems more blatantly and with innovation. Moreover, searching for effective and efficient solutions for each problem. 
* Being a visual learner, associating ideas, words and concepts with images assists in better understanding and retaining information. Having multiple different learning styles allows the team to perceive and think in a different perspective. ]
